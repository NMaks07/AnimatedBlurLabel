# Installation
Copy the **AnimatedBlurLabel.swift** file to your Swift project, add it to your target and you're good to go.

# Usage
The easiest way to get started is to add the AnimatedBlurLabel as a custom label in your Storyboard. After that, you can set properties like animation duration or blur radius in code:

```swift
blurLabel.animationDuration = 1.0
blurLabel.blurRadius = 30.0
```

In order to blur and unblur the label's text, you simply call the following method:

```swift
func setBlurred(blurred: Bool, animated: Bool, completion: ((finished : Bool) -> Void)?)
```
